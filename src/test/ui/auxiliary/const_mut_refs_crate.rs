// This is a support file for ../const-mut-refs-main.rs

// This is to test that static inners from an external
// crate like this one, still preserves the alloc.
// That is, the address from the standpoint of rustc+llvm
// is the same.
// The need for this test originated from the GH issue
// https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57349

// See also ../const-mut-refs-main.rs for more details
// about this test.
